    <h2>Experiment 3: Density Tower Experiment</h2>
    <h3>Build a Tower of Liquids! </h3>

    <p>Ever wondered why some objects float while others sink? In this experiment, you’ll create a colorful tower using different liquids like honey, water, and oil. Each liquid has a different density, which allows them to stack in layers. You’ll also test how objects float or sink depending on their density. </p>
    
    <h3>What You’ll Do</h3>
        <p>You’re going to stack common household liquids to form a tower. Then, you’ll drop small objects into the tower to see how density determines whether they sink, float, or settle in between.</p>
    
    <h3>What You’ll Need</h3>
    <p>Here’s everything you’ll need for this experiment:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Clear Glass or Container:</strong> To see the layers clearly.</li>
      <li><strong>Hoey or Syrup:</strong> The densest layer.</li>
      <li><strong>Water:</strong> Add food colouring for fun.</li>
      <li><strong>Cooking Oil:</strong> A lighter liquid for the upper layer.</li>
      <li><strong>Optional Liquids:</strong> Rubbing alcohol, milk, or dish soap for more layers.</li>
      <li><strong>Small Objects:</strong> Examples include a coin, grape, ping-pong ball, paperclip, and bead.</li>
      <li><strong>Spoon or Pipette:</strong> To carefully add the liquids.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps to Follow</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Prepare Your Liquids:</strong>
        <p>Pour each liquid into a separate cup. You can add food coloring to water or rubbing alcohol to make them colorful and easy to identify. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Layer the Liquids:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Start by pouring the heaviest liquid (honey or syrup) into the container.</li>
          <li>Slowly and gently add the next liquid (like colored water) by pouring it over the back of a spoon.</li>
          <li>Continue adding layers with lighter liquids, like oil, until your tower is complete.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Test Object Buoyancy:</strong>
        <p>Drop small objects into the density tower one at a time. Watch where they settle in the layers and take note of their position. </p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>What’s Happening?</h3>
    <p>Here’s the science behind it:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Density* refers to how much “stuff” is packed into a space. Heavier liquids like honey have more density and sink to the bottom, while lighter liquids like oil stay on top.</li>
      <li>Objects float or sink based on their density compared to the liquid they are in. A ping-pong ball floats on oil but sinks in water, while a coin sinks to the bottom. </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Try These Fun Variations</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Add more liquids, like dish soap or rubbing alcohol, to create more layers.</li>
      <li>Predict where each object will settle before dropping it in.</li>
      <li>Stir the liquids gently and watch them slowly separate back into layers over time.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Tips for Success</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>⁠Pour liquids slowly to avoid mixing them. Using the back of a spoon helps control the flow.</li>  
        <li>⁠Use clear containers for the best visual effect.</li>  
        <li>⁠Clean up spills immediately to avoid sticky messes.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Why It’s Cool</h3>
    <p>This experiment is a fantastic way to explore the concept of density. It’s colorful, easy to set up, and helps you understand why some objects float while others sink. Plus, it’s a great science fair project that’s sure to grab attention! </p>
